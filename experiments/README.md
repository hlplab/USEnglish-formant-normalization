# Experiments 1a and 1b
This folder contains scripts and stimuli for the two web-based vowel categorization experiments reported in Persson, Barreda & Jaeger (2024). All scripts and stimuli are located in the experiment-A folder.
Both experiments used the same javascript and html-file for launching and running the experiment (experiment-A.js, experiment-A.html).
The stimuli for both experiments is located in the stimuli/test/ folder. The subfolder natural/E2/ contains the 72 vowel recordings from one of the talkers in the Xie & Jaeger (2020) database that we used in Experiment 1a. The subfolder NORM-A/ contains the 146 synthesized stimuli used in Experiment 1b.
