This folder contains csv-files of the following types:
- F1-F2 values (in Miller normalization space) for the synthesized stimuli used in Experiment 1b (Li_Xie_2020_femaleL1_manual_testgrid_E2.csv)
- Formant statistics from the talker used in Experiment 1a used to repair mis-labeling of sound files in the Xie-Jaeger-2020-repair.Rmd (Li_Xie_2020_L1_vowels_statistics_general.csv)
- Repaired formant statistics for the stimuli used in both experiments (vowel-formants-Experiment-1a.csv and vowel-formants-Experiment-1b.csv). The latter file was used to generate the synthesized stimuli (by the Praat script in scripts/Praat/)
- Formant statistics from all talkers in the Xie & Jaeger database, used to train the ideal observers (Xie_Jaeger_2020_L1_vowels_statistics_allTimepoints.csv)
