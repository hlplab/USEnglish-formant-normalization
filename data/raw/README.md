This folder contains raw data from the two experiments conducted.
- experiment-A/production/ folder contains the data collected via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (experiment-NORM-A-natural.tab for Experiment 1a; experiment-NORM-A.tab for Experiment 1b)
- the additional data collected via Prolific is located in a different repository (Eng-vowel-normalization)
- the pre-processing of the raw experiment data (essentially data-wrangling) is done in an experiment report. This is located in the Eng-vowel-normalization repo (at Eng-vowel-normalization/scripts/experiment-reports/experiment-A/Report-Production-Norming-Experiment-1A-1B.Rmd). The output of that pre-processing is the Experiment-NORM-AB-before-processing.csv file, located in this repository at data/.
