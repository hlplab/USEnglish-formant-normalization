- Experiment-1a-1b-before-processing.csv: pre-processed participant data including stimuli properties *before exclusions*. The pre-processing -- essentially data-wrangling -- is done in an experiment report located in a different repository (Eng-vowel-normalization repository, at Eng-vowel-normalization/scripts/experiment-reports/experiment-A/Report-Production-Norming-Experiment-1A-1B.Rmd).
- Experiment-1a-1b-after-exclusions.csv: participant responses including stimuli properties after pre-processing *and* exclusions.
- Experiment-1a-1b-after-exclusions-with-normalization.csv: participant responses including normalized stimuli properties after pre-processing *and* exclusions.
- raw-data/: raw participant data before pre-processing
  - experiment-1a.tab: raw participant for Experiment 1a.
  - experiment-1b.tab: raw participant data for Experiment 1b.
- raw-data (sandbox testing)/: data from pilot testing the experiments on Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

- the additional data collected via Prolific in October 2024 is located in a different repository (Eng-vowel-normalization)
